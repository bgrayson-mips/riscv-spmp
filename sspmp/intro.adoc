== Introduction

This document describes the RISC-V S-mode Physical Memory Protection (SPMP) proposal to provide isolation when an MMU is unavailable or disabled.
RISC-V based processors recently stimulated great interest in the emerging internet of things (IoT) and automotive devices. 
However, page-based virtual memory (typically via an MMU) is usually undesired in order to meet resource and latency constraints.
Without an MMU, it is difficult on such devices to isolate the S-mode OSes (e.g., RTOS) and user-mode applications from each other.
The SPMP extension provides mechanisms for an S-mode OS to support secure processing and fault isolation of U-mode software via limiting the physical addresses accessible by U-mode software on a hart.
