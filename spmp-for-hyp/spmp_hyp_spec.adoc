=== Hypervisor-Extended SPMP (hSPMP)

The Shpmp extension enhances the behavior of the original SPMP so that when the Hypervisor extension is present the behavior of the SPMP is enhanced to an hypervisor-extended SPMP (hSPMP). When V=0, the hSPMP acts as the baseline SPMP. When V=1 and hgatp.mode=Bare the hSPMP checks all guest memory accesses, i.e., all accesses  from VS or VU modes. The enconding permissions remain the same as for the baseline SPMP for when spmpcfg.S is clear, but enforcing the rule over VS/VU modes instead of U mode.
// Table ?? summarizes the rule permission check encodings (refer to the baseline SPMP specification for more details).

Note that the Hypervisor Virtual Machine Load and Store instructions (HLV/HLVX/HSV) executed from M, HS or HU (when hstatus.HU is set) modes are also subject to the same hSPMP checks as when V=1.

When a guest access is denied by the hSPMP an exception is generated. Depending on the type of access (i.e., load, store/AMO, or instruction fetch) a different kind of fault is generated. The hSPMP reuses exception codes from the Hypervisor extension for guest page faults since SPMP protection and paged virtual memory are mutually exclusive and cannot be active at the same time as the SPMP is only enabled when satp.mode == Bare. Essentially this extension renames these exception codes as detailed in Table ?? seen next.

The hSPMP adds an extra hypervisor WARL CSR pair to the SPMP, hspmpswitch0-1. When V=1 these CSRs take the role of the original spmpswitch0-1. This means that, when V=1, hSPMP entry is active only when both corresponding bits in hspmpswitch and spmp[i]cfg,A are set. When V=0, these registers have no effect.

=== Guest/Virtual SPMP (vSPMP)

This extension introduces a new PMP, the vSPMP, behaving exactly as the original SPMP, but under the control of VS-mode and checking accesses from VS and VU modes, therefore only active when V=1. Essentially, this extension introduces a two-stage SPMP before the PMP/ePMP (Figure ??). From a logical point of view, when both vsatp.mode and hgatp.mode are set to Bare, guest accesses (i.e., originating from VS/VU) are first checked by the the vSPMP, and if allowed, then checked by the hSPMP. Meaning that if the access is denied both by the vSPMP and the hSPMP, an SPMP fault is generated (i.e., fault with exception code 12, 13 or 15). The implementation can perform vSPMP checks in parallel with hSPMP cheks.

For the purposes of full aligment with the baseline Hypervisor specification, and from a logical point of view, addresses used before vSPMP checks are considered to be guest virtual addresses (GVA), and those checked by the hSPMP are guest physical addresses (GPA).

If vsatp.mode is set to Bare but hgatp.mode is not, the vSPMP check is logically followed by the usual G-stage translation. Implementations can implement them in parallel.

If vsatp.mode is not set to bare, but hgapt.mode is, the hSPMP happens logically after the VS-stage transaction. Implementations must use the guest physical address (GPA), resulting from the VS-stage translation, to perform the hSPMP check, meaning a parallel check is not feasible unless speculation is employed.

VS mode controls the vSPMP through a number of new virtual supervisors CSRs (VS CSRs), replicas of the normal SPMP supervisor CSRs. These include vspmpcfg0-3, vspmpaddr0-64 CSRS, and vspmpswitch0-1. As with the virtual supervisors CSRs in the baseline Hypervisor specification, when V=1, accesses to original SPMP CSRs, are diverted to these VS CSRs.

The number of vSPMP entries can vary by implementation, and up to 64 SPMP entries are supported in the standard.
